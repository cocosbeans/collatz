# Collatz Conjecture
The Collatz Conjecture states that there is no real number that will not always become 1 for the following equation:<br>
### 3n+1 if n is odd, or
### n/2 if n is even
Over 295 quintillion numbers have been tested in the Collatz conjecture, and none have disproved it.<br>
This repo is an implementation of the Collatz conjecture in as many languages as I can think of
